    "Of all the models I evaluated, Nearest neighbors performs best both on cost and performance metrics. Even with 300 datapoints, k-NN needs only 0.0067 seconds to evaluate test data and returns a respectable score F1 score of 0.8138. SVM was a close second, however, it seems it is suffering from overfitting. This is because it's score actually decreases as we add more data points. Random Forest seems to be the worst of all, suffering from overfitting as well as being computationaly expensive."

    "k-NN or k nearest neighbor algorithm is one of the more simpler model to explain. Given a student's data, k-NN looks at k students who are most similar to this student (nearest neighbors), examines if they passed or failed and picks the result based on that. During training phase, this model just stores the data of all the students. During testing phase, it tries to find close neighbors and examines their trajectory. The trick in this model comes to picking who should be a \"neighbor\" to a student and how should similarity be measured. Should we measure similarity of their economic background, romantic interests or some combination of other characteristics."
